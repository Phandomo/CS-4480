1.1.3*

- Be able to define what is meant with a network protocol.
- Be able to design and explain network protocols to achieve certain functionality using a ladder diagram. (Like in Figure 1.2).

==========================================================================================
- A network protocol defines the format and order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on transmission/receipt of a message or event.

- Figure 1.2 is the "human protocol" example of saying hi and asking for the time
==========================================================================================


1.3.1*

- Be able to explain the devices and mechanisms involved in packet switched networks.
- Be able to reason about the transmission delay experienced in a packet switched network based on the packet length and transmission rate.
- Be able to explain why queueing delay and packet loss might occur in a packet switched network.
- Be able to explain the relationship between forwarding and routing in a packet switched network.

==========================================================================================
- packet switching uses store-and-forward transmission (routers and link-layer switches)

- a packet of L bits sent over a link with transmission rate R bits/sec takes L/R seconds to transmit

- a packet is queued when the output buffer of a router is busy; packet loss occurs when the buffer/queue are completely full

- each router has a forwarding table that maps destination addresses to its outbound links
==========================================================================================


1.3.3**

- Be able to explain the structure and role players involved in the global Internet.

==========================================================================================
+ end systems connect via access ISPs
+ access ISPs connect to regional ISPs
+ regional IPSs connect to tier-1 ISPs
+ multiple ISPs peer together at an IXP (Internet eXchange Point)
+ don't forget about content provider networks (e.g. Google, your future employer)
==========================================================================================


1.4.1**

- Be able to define and reason about the different kinds of delay that can be experienced in packet switched network.
- Be able to explain under what conditions the relative contribution of different delay components would be more prominent.

==========================================================================================
- processing delay   = time to examine a packet's header and determine where to direct it
- queuing delay      = time waiting to be transmitted
- transmission delay = time to transmit all of a packet's bits onto a link
- propagation delay  = time to travel across a link

- the longer the link, the greater the propagation delay
==========================================================================================


1.4.2**

- Be able to define traffic intensity and its relation to queueing delay.

==========================================================================================
- a = average packet arrival rate (packets/sec)
- L = size of packet in bits
- R = transmission rate
- if La/R > 1, then bits are arriving faster than they can be transmitted
==========================================================================================


1.4.3**

- Be able to express and reason about the end-to-end delay as a function of the individual nodal delays.
- Be able to explain how the traceroute tool output is produced (under the hood) and be able to interpret the output of a traceroute run.

==========================================================================================
- delay_end = N(delay_proc + delay_trans + delay_prop)

                       ... or ...

- delay_end = N(delay_proc +     L/R     + delay_prop)

- the source sends 3 packets addressed to the destination
- each router along the way sends a message back to the source
- the source records the times and hops
- and the output follows this pattern...

    n router-name (IP address) RTT1 RTT2 RTT3

...where n is the router's number in the hop list
==========================================================================================


1.4.4**

- Be able to explain and reason about the concepts of throughput and bottleneck links in computer networks.

==========================================================================================
- instantaneous throughput is the rate at which data is being received at any given instant in time
- average throughput is: F bits / T sec
- bottleneck link is the minimum rate of all the link rates
==========================================================================================


1.5.1*

- Be able to explain the concept of a layered architecture in computer networks.
- Be able to list and describe the basic functionality of the layers in the Internet protocol stack.

==========================================================================================
- application -> transport ->   network  ->   link  -> physical
   (message)     (segment)    (datagram)    (frame)
==========================================================================================


1.5.2*

- Be able to explain the concept of encapsulation and how it applies in the Internet layered architecture.

==========================================================================================
- each layer adds a header with its own message on the way out, then reads/strips that message on the way in
==========================================================================================


1.6*

- Be able to explain examples of how bad guys might attack endpoints and the network and the communication it enables.

==========================================================================================
- DoS
- DDoS
==========================================================================================


1.7

- Know the number and location of the first nodes of the ARPAnet and the first function that was performed and its result. (And take heart...)

==========================================================================================
- four nodes: UCLA, Stanford, UCSB, and UofU
==========================================================================================
