Note: By "reason about" I mean understand something well enough
that you can argue its pros and cons, not just give a definition.
Also, where applicable, "reason about" would include reproducing and using
the symbolic definitions (or equations) you have used in the homework
problems.

1.1

1.1.1

- Know the terminology of components and role-players that make up the Internet.

+ hosts or end systems
+ servers
+ routers (circular)
+ switches (square)
+ modems
+ base stations (wireless)
+ cell towers


1.1.2

- Understand and be able to explain concepts behind distributed 
applications and APIs as it relates to the Internet.

+ distributed applications involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other (e.g. email, web, social networks)
+ API in this context defines a set of rules for how a program asks the Internet to deliver data to a destination


1.1.3*

- Be able to define what is meant with a network protocol.
- Be able to design and explain network protocols to achieve
certain functionality using a ladder diagram. (Like in Figure 1.2).

+ A network protocol defines the format and order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on transmission/receipt of a message or event.
+ Figure 1.2 is the "human protocol" example of saying hi and asking for the time


1.2

1.2.1

- Be able to explain the basic working of and differences between
different access network technologies. Including typical up- and
down-link speeds for each.

+ DSL = existing telephone line (twisted-pair copper); 12-24 Mbps down and 1.8-2.5 Mbps up
+ cable = fiber to neighborhood, coax to homes (hybrid fiber coax (HFC)); 42.8 Mbps down and 30.7 Mbps up
+ FTTH = fiber to the home (Google Fiber!)


- Be able to explain the basic workings of enterprise and home
networking technologies. Including typical link speeds.

+ Ethernet with 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, or 10 Gbps
+ 802.11 with 54 Mbps shared
+ 3G with 1 Mbps
+ LTE with 10 Mbps


1.2.2

- Be able to describe the workings and tradeoff of different 
physical media.

+ guided = wired
+ unguided = waves
+ twisted-pair copper = least expensive and most used
+ coax = shared medium of copper conductors
+ fiber optics = excellent for long distances
+ earth and satellite radios


1.3

1.3.1*

- Be able to explain the devices and mechanisms involved in packet
switched networks.

+ packet switching using store-and-forward transmission (routers and link-layer switches)


- Be able to reason about the transmission delay experienced in a packet switched
network based on the packet length and transmission rate.

+ a packet of L bits sent over a link with transmission rate R bits/sec takes L/R seconds to transmit


- Be able to explain why queueing delay and packet loss might occur in a
packet switched network.

+ a packet is queued when the output buffer of a router is busy
+ packet loss occurs when the buffer/queue are completely full


- Be able to explain the relationship between forwarding and routing
in a packet switched network.

+ each router has a forwarding table that maps destination addresses to its outbound links


1.3.2

- Be able to explain the workings of a circuit switched network.

+ resources are reserved for the duration of the communication session


- Be able to explain how frequency-division multiplexing and time-division
multiplexing relate to circuit switched networks.

+ FDM = spectrum divided among connections
+ TDM = time is divided into frames of fixed duration


- Be able to explain the tradeoffs between packet and circuit switched
networks and the conditions under which either approach would be favored
over the other.

+ circuit switching = better at phone/voice services
+ packet switching = better sharing of capacity, more efficient, and less costly


1.3.3**

- Be able to explain the structure and role players involved in the global
Internet.

+ end systems connect via access ISPs
+ access ISPs connect to regional ISPs
+ regional IPSs connect to tier-1 ISPs
+ multiple ISPs peer together at an IXP (Internet eXchange Point)
+ don't forget about content provider networks (e.g. Google)


1.4**

1.4.1**

- Be able to define and reason about the different kinds of delay that can be
experienced in packet switched network.

+ processing delay   = time to examine a packet's header and determine where to direct it
+ queuing delay      = time waiting to be transmitted
+ transmission delay = time to transmit all of a packet's bits into a link
+ propagation delay  = time travel across a link


- Be able to explain under what conditions the relative contribution
of different delay components would be more prominent.

+ the longer the link, the greater the propagation delay


1.4.2**

- Be able to define traffic intensity and its relation to queueing delay.

+ a = average packet arrival rate (packets/sec)
+ L = size of packet in bits
+ R = transmission rate
+ if La/R > 1, then bits are arriving faster than they can be transmitted


1.4.3**

- Be able to express and reason about the end-to-end delay as a function of
the individual nodal delays.

+ delay_end = N(delay_proc + delay_trans + delay_prop)

                       ... or ...

+ delay_end = N(delay_proc + L/R + delay_prop)


- Be able to explain how the traceroute tool output is produced (under the hood)
and be able to interpret the output of a traceroute run.

+ the source sends 3 packets addressed to the destination
+ each router along the way sends a message back to the source
+ the source records the times and hops

+ The output follows this pattern...

    n router-name (IP address) RTT1 RTT2 RTT3

...where n is the router's number in the hop list


1.4.4**

- Be able to explain and reason about the concepts of throughput and bottleneck
links in computer networks.

+ instantaneous throughput is the rate at which data is being received at any instant of time
+ average throughput is: F bits / T sec
+ bottleneck link is the minimum rate of all the link rates


1.5

1.5.1*

- Be able to explain the concept of a layered architecture in computer networks.
- Be able to list and describe the basic functionality of the layers
in the Internet protocol stack.

+ application -> transport -> network -> link -> physical


1.5.2*

- Be able to explain the concept of encapsulation and how it applies in the
Internet layered architecture.

+ each layer adds a header with its own message on the way out, then reads/strips that message on the way in


1.6*

- Be able to explain examples of how bad guys might attack endpoints
and the network and the communication it enables.

+ DoS
+ DDoS


1.7

- Know the number and location of the first nodes of the ARPAnet and the
first function that was performed and its result. (And take heart...)

+ four nodes: UCLA, Stanford, UCSB, and UofU
