3. End-point authentication (trust)
4. Operational security (firewalls IDSs)
==========================================================================================


8.2*

- Be able to explain the characters and terminology used in cryptography.

==========================================================================================

==========================================================================================


8.2.1*

- Be able to explain the basic functioning of symmetric key cryptography.
- Be able to list and explain the types of attacks an intruder might use against an encryption scheme.
- Be able to give an intuitive explanation of why block ciphers are needed to perform effective symmetric key cryptography.
- Be able to explain the concept of cipher-block chaining.
- Be able to explain how an initialization vector (IV) is used in cipher-block chaining.

==========================================================================================
Attacks:
	- ciphertext-only  (statistical analysis)
	- known-plaintext  (Trudy knows for sure that something is in the message)
	- chosen-plaintext (Trudy gets Alice to send a specific message)


==========================================================================================


8.2.2**

- Be able to explain the basic functioning of public key encryption/decryption.

8.3*

- Be able to explain the concepts of message integrity.

8.3.1*

- Be able to explain the key property of a cryptographic hash function.

8.3.2*

- Be ale to explain what a message authentication code is and how one can be constructed and used. (Either through a prosaic explanation or by using a figure like figure 8.9).

8.3.3**

- Be able to explain what a digital signature is and how it could be used.
- Be able to explain the concept of public key certification.
- Be able to explain the function of a certification authority. (Either through a prosaic explanation or by using a figure like figure 8.14).

8.4

- Be able to explain what is mean with end-point authentication.

8.4.5*

- Be able to explain the interactions and components involved with an authentication protocol (like ap4.0).

8.5

8.5.1*

- Be able to explain how symmetric key cryptography, public key cryptography, hash functions and digital signatures can be combined to provide secrecy, sender authentication and message integrity in a message passing application like email.

8.6*

- Be able to explain the purpose of the secure sockets layer and  where/how it fits in the protocol stack.

8.6.1*

- Be able to explain the "almost-SSL" handshake and the purpose of each message.
- Be able to describe the key derivation process for "almost-SSL".
- Be able to explain the data transfer phase of "almost-SSL".

8.6.2*

- Explain why the "real" SSL handshake involves the client and the server exchanging a MAC of all previous handshake messages.
- Explain why the real SSL protocol makes use of an explicit connection closure message type.

8.7

- Be able to explain the type of security IPSec provides.
- Be able to explain why (i) security at the networking level (IPSec) is useful, (ii) security at the networking level is not by itself sufficient for network security needs.

8.7.1*

- Be able to explain the concept of a virtual private network.
- Be able to explain how IPSec can be used to create a VPN across the public Internet.

8.8
